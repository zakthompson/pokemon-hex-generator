	(C) HORI
This project implements a modified version of HORI's Pokken Tournament Pro Pad
USB descriptors to allow for the creation of custom controllers for the
Nintendo Switch. This also works to a limited degree on the PS3.
Since System Update v3.0.0, the Nintendo Switch recognizes the Pokken
Tournament Pro Pad as a Pro Controller. Physical design limitations prevent
the Pokken Controller from functioning at the same level as the Pro
Controller. However, by default most of the descriptors are there, with the
exception of Home and Capture. Descriptor modification allows us to unlock
these buttons for our use.

/*------------------------------------------*/
// INSTRUCTIONS
// -> Your player must be on their bicycle in Bridge Field, no menus or dialogues open
// -> You must have ONLY 1 pokemon in your party
// -> The pokemon in your party needs to have Flame Body, Magma Armor, or Steam Engine
// -> You must be disconnected from the internet
// -> Your cursor must be over "Town Map" in the main menu (game remembers its position)
// -> Your main menu must be the default without menu items moved around!
// -> If they are moved, "Town Map" needs to be 1 down and 1 left from "Pokemon" in the main menu
// -> You must have a series of EMPTY boxes that you want to fill, and you must have selected the
//    first empty box in the series (game remembers which box you had open last)
// -> You have to start this program at the Change Grip/Order menu

/*------------------------------------------*/
// NOTES
// -> This program does not guarantee picking up the maximum number of eggs per cycle due to the
//    RNG for collecting eggs. If you have the oval charm, and the pokemon are same species and different
//    trainers, there is an 88% chance per pick-up that an egg will be available. This means even given
//    the best setup, you will likely only hatch ~9 eggs per two cycles, and not 10. The bot cannot
//    know if we pick up an egg or not, so we assume that we always get an egg. You will most definitely
//    have some empty spaces in your boxes after running this for a while, but it can't be helped.
// -> For reasons mentioned above, it is highly recommended that you have the oval charm.
