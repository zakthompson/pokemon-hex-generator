# Pokemon Scripts for Arduino

## Introduction
Since the Nintendo Switch now supports USB controllers, some enterprising individuals reverse-engineered the Pokken Tournament Pro Pad firmware for use on microcontrollers. This repository is a collection of scripts which execute input loops on the controller that allow for automating repetitive tasks in Pokemon Sword & Shield, such as hosting raids and hatching eggs.

## Instructions
* You will need to have `avr-gcc` installed on your system
* In the `makefile`, change the `TARGET` to the script you'd like to build
* Ensure that the `MCU` is set the the appropriate chipset for your microcontroller (for example, `atmega16u2` for an Arduino UNO R3)
* Run `make`
* Flash the resulting `.hex` file to your microcontroller

The instructions for putting your microcontroller in DFU mode and flashing firmware differ depending on your hardware. If you are on a Mac and have `dfu-programmer` installed, you can use the `make flash` command to flash the `TARGET` hex to your board.

## Scripts
* **DaySkipper**: Auto day-skipper for skips up to 22280 days
* **DaySkipper_Unlimited**: DaySkipper but with no limit
* **Auto3DaySkipper**: Auto roll den to the 3rd day, SR and repeats
* **AutoLoto**: Infinite loto reward grinding
* **AutoFossil**: Shiny Fossil grinding
* **AutoHost**: Auto hosting raids, with optional fixed/random link code
* **TurboA**: A button masher (for digging duo)
* **WattFarmer**: Fast watt collector
* **BerryFarmer**: Fast berry farmer
* **BoxRelease**: Release all pokemon in PC boxes
* **EggCollector**: Automatically collect eggs
* **EggHatcher**: Batch hatch eggs
* **FriendDeleteAdd**: Quickly remove as many friends as you'd like, and optionally add more
* **InifiniteHatcher**: Continously collect and hatch eggs using a single bot

Each of these have instructions written in the README in their folder. Several also have configuration options that you will need to set in the `Config.h` file in their folder.

## Pre-Compiled Hexes
In the build folder, you will find precompiled hexes for the scripts that don't require variables to be changed.  These include:
* Auto3DaySkipper_US
* AutoLoto_US
* AutoHost (No Link Code)
* AutoHostWithFriendAccept (No Link Code)
* AutoHostReroll (No Link Code)
* AutoHostRerollWithFriendAccept (No Link Code)
* TurboA
* BerryFarmer_US
* WattFarmer_US

**Note that these builds are for `atmega16u2` boards such as the Arduino UNO R3. They will not work if your board has a different chipset!**

## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull-request with a clear explanation of what improvement you are adding. I will review it as quickly as I can.

## Credits
These scripts originate from various people, and have been tweaked, modified and optimized along the way. As more contribute, I'll try and keep this list up-to-date.
