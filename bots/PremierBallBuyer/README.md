# Instructions
1. Text speed set to fast
2. Ensure you have enough money
3. Ensure that your bag cursor is over normal Poke Balls
4. Talk to a normal Poke Mart man and enter the buying page and have your cursor over Poke Ball
5. Plug in the bot

The bot keeps buying 10 Poke Balls until you hit the target you want then sell off either all of your Poke Balls or just the amount you bought.
If you want to get X Premier Balls, ensure you have â‚½2000X first! You will get back half of the money when you sell the Poke Balls back but you need to have enough for buying the Poke Balls.

## Configuration Options
### to_buy
The number of Premier Balls you want to get. Please don't set it above 99 because you can't have more than 999 items in your bag!

### sell_all
Can be set to true or false. If true, you will sell ALL of your normal Poke Balls. If false, it will only sell the amount you bought.
